## General Information
This repository contains a workflow for simulating various whisker dynamics and statics as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07143). For related data (e.g., indentation, SEM, microCT), please refer to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.17617/3.ROQPWZ">Edmond data repository</a>. This repository demonstrates a streamlined workflow for analyzing **functionally graded whiskers** under various loading scenarios using the nonlinear finite element platform **Abaqus**, with minimal manual intervention. 

💡 Tip: You can switch between [Light and Dark mode](https://github.com/settings/appearance) in your GitHub profile settings for better readability. This repo is designed to be vieewed in Light mode.

Running any script in this directory initiates a fully automated pipeline that:
- Sets up simulations programmatically in **MATLAB** (including meshing, material properties, and boundary conditions),
- Executes simulations via command-line calls to Abaqus,
- Processes simulation output, and
- Generates publication-ready figures from the results.

These tools reproduce results from the associated paper or enable analysis of related problems. For academic use, the **[Abaqus Learning Edition](https://www.3ds.com/edu/education/students/solutions/abaqus-le)** (free, node-limited) is a suitable alternative to the full commercial license, as long as mesh sizes remain small. Full implementation details are provided in the main paper's **[Supplemental Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07143)**.

## Simulation Assumptions, Boundary Conditions, Independent Variables

For all simulations, a few assumptions are made.

<details>
	
### Variable Assumptions

The following gradients are treated as linearly distributed variables from base (root) to tip:

1. **Symmetric Geometry**: The beam is assumed to be transversely symmetric, meaning the cross-section has the same moment of inertia about both principal axes ($I_x = I_y$).
2. **Geometry Gradient**: The diameter tapers linearly from the base to the tip.
3. **Porosity Gradient**: Porosity changes linearly from the base to the tip and may increase or decrease depending on input.
4. **Stiffness Gradient**: Young’s modulus varies linearly along the length of the beam, with customizable direction of the gradient.

### Independent Variables in the simulation
The following table summarizes the main adjustable parameters for the whisker-inspired beam. These include geometry, material stiffness, porosity, and loading conditions. Note that individual MATLAB scripts may also define additional boundary conditions. Note you can use either the visual image or the table to see the labels of the whisker simulation.

| Variable Description                         | Variable Name         | Units   |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Whisker length                               | `W.Length`             | mm      |
| Diameter at base                             | `W.D_base`             | μm      |
| Diameter at tip                              | `W.D_tip`              | μm      |
| Modulus at base                              | `W.E_base`             | MPa     |
| Modulus at tip                               | `W.E_tip`              | MPa     |
| Porosity at base                            | `Porosity_base`        | %       |
| Porosity at tip                               | `Porosity_Tip`         | %       |
| Applied Transverse load at tip               | `W.appliedMoment`      | N       |
| Prescribed transverse displacement at tip    | `W.prescribedDisp`     | mm      |

### Boundary Condition Assumptions
1. **Base is fixed**: The base has a boundary condition of fixed for all simulations
2. **Tip depends on simulation**: The tip boundary condition has differing boundary conditions that are explained in the simulation sub-heading. 
For specific simulations, there are different boundary conditions for the point which can be found here:

| Simulation File Name | Simulation Description | Tip Boundary Condition | Model Outputs |                         
|---------------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------|
|`W.Length`| Quasi-static applied transverse load at tip viewing tip displacement                             | $$f_y\vert_{x=L}$$ | $$\overrightarrow{u(x)}$$     |
|`W.Length`| Quasi-static prescribed transverse displacement at tip                            | $$u_y\vert_{x=L}$$ | $$\sigma_{11}\vert_{x=0}$$     |
|`W.Length`| Dynamic prescribed transveerse displacement distance $$a$$ from base                            | $$u_y\vert_{x=a}$$ | $$\overrightarrow{u(x,t)}$$ and $$M_z(t)\vert_{x=0}$$   |
|`W.Length`| Dynamic prescribed transveerse displacement distance $$a$$ from base for free vibration                       | $$u_y\vert_{x=a}$$ | $$\overrightarrow{u(x,t)}$$ and $$M_z(t)\vert_{x=0}$$     |

## FEA Validation and Mesh-convergence

Overall this GitHub allows a step-by-step tutorial for running simulations on running several non-linear simulations, however with any FEA simulations its critical to first perform a non-linear parametric study and mesh convergence to determine FEA settings and mesh-size.


<details>

### Finite-element validation

For running validation for your simulation, there is a quick study to understand if linear or non-linear methods are necessary: 

1. **Finite-element validation**: Start with a simple beam tip displacement test to determine if the simulation's boundary conditions are satisfied and it behaves as a eulerian beam. 

### FEA mesh-convergence study

For running a mesh convergence for your simulation, we have included a quick script that allows you to run a mesh convergence study, plot the data, and analyze the results. 

1. **Mesh-convergence script**: For the mesh script open the MATLAB command window and run the following: 
```bash
run_modal_analysis.m
```
